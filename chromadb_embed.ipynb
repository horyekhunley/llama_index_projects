It allows us to continuously A/B test common ML workflows – enabling proactive improvements and automatically preventing regressions on TTFB. \\n  * AI Lab prevents TTFB regressions whilst enabling experimentation to develop improvements. For example, during the rollout of the open source [Python Cinder runtime](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder), AI Lab was used to yield a 2x increase on original TTFB improvements, reducing [TTFB by up to 40%](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/01/18/developer-tools/lazy-imports-cinder-machine-learning-meta/).\\n\\nTime to first batch (TTFB), the delay from when a workflow is submitted to the\\ntraining job’s first batch, plays an important role in accelerating our\\nmachine learning (ML) engineers’ iteration speeds. Essentially, TTFB is the\\ntime elapsed from the moment you hit the “start” button on your ML model\\ntraining to the point when the first batch of data enters the model for\\nprocessing. TTFB influences the overhead for all ML training jobs and is\\nessentially the moment when developers first get a signal on their job.\\n\\nBy minimizing TTFB we’re unblocking our ML engineers, increasing the number of\\niterations they can do per day, and improving the overall speed of innovation\\nat Meta.\\n\\nSupporting TTFB across Meta requires a scalable offering to not only enable\\nproactive improvements on this valuable metric, but also keep it healthy\\nautonomously. To this end we’ve created AI Lab, a pre-production TTFB signal\\ngeneration tool which empowers infra owners to ship new changes with high\\nconfidence, reducing [TTFB by up to\\n40%](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/01/18/developer-tools/lazy-imports-\\ncinder-machine-learning-meta/). This, coupled with automatic prevention of\\nregressions keeps ML engineers moving fast across Meta.\\n\\n## Optimizing TTFB helps ML engineers move fast\\n\\nThe overhead induced from TTFB is on the critical path for most ML\\ndevelopment. It is composed of components like config validation, feature pre-\\nprocessing, and infra overhead (like queuing for capacity). Optimizations to\\ncomponents of TTFB can even impact the entire training cycle of some models.\\nAt Meta’s scale, the metric value of TTFB often subtly changes as developers\\niterate on their model, launcher, or architecture.\\n\\n![](https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-Lab-\\nimage-1.png?w=1024)Example TTFB measurement with components.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo get and keep ML engineers moving fast, two things are required:\\n\\n  1. **Offensively improve TTFB:** We need an intuitive, easy-to-use experimentation framework that allows users to quantify the impact of their changes, enabling fast iteration, and impact certification of new features, empowering infra owners to ship new changes with high confidence.\\n  2. **Defensively prevent regressions on TTFB:** We need continuous regression prevention that tests the latest changes in a low-noise environment, whilst providing a way to monitor, detect, and prevent regressions from affecting ML engineers in the first place.\\n\\n## Introducing AI Lab\\n\\nAI Lab is a specialized pre-production framework in which we continuously\\nexecute common ML workflows as an A/B test to accurately measure the impact of\\nrecent changes on metrics like TTFB. Built on top of the same systems as\\n[MobileLab](https://engineering.fb.com/2018/10/19/android/mobilelab/), AI Lab\\nautomatically defends TTFB by preventing regressions prior to release and\\nenables offensive TTFB improvements opportunistically as an experimentation\\nframework.\\n\\nBuilding AI Lab presented unique challenges. Because GPU capacity is such a\\nprecious resource, we had to ensure we were a net positive to capacity usage\\nacross Meta. We took care to work with partners on shrunk models and simple\\nconfigurations like some that could run on only CPUs, but still prevent the\\nregressions that would regularly tie up GPUs. To this end, we created an auto-\\nshrinker that aims to ensure tests run the same code / configurations as\\nproduction; except consume less compute resources. It does things like reduce\\nthe number of training iterations and model size, even enabling more\\ndeterministic behavior. These tests often run in <10 minutes, which is\\nbeneficial for developers iterating on potential TTFB changes. We also needed\\na holistic strategy to scale to the size of Meta, something we’ll cover in a\\nlater section.\\n\\n![](https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-Lab-\\nimage-2.png?w=1014)AI Lab finding a regression in TTFB.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s jump into a real example for how we can leverage a tool like AI Lab to\\nreduce TTFB.\\n\\n## Reducing TTFB with the Python Cinder runtime and AI Lab\\n\\nMeta’s open source [Python Cinder\\nruntime](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder) brought with it up to a\\n[40% improvement in TTFB](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/01/18/developer-\\ntools/lazy-imports-cinder-machine-learning-meta/) thanks to the aggressive\\nlazy imports. Here, we see the true utility of a framework like AI Lab and how\\nit was used to facilitate this sweeping change.\\n\\n### Offensively\\n\\nWe can leverage AI Lab instead of experimenting on real ML engineers’\\nworkflows that may require days or weeks of turnaround to validate a\\nperformance hypothesis. With AI Lab, in less than an hour, we’re able to\\naccurately test and measure the impact of a proposed Cinder version on TTFB\\nacross a comprehensive set of representative ML scenarios.\\n\\nIn practice, developers turned this into an iteration loop to test further\\noptimizations and fine-tune Cinder, yielding a 2x increase on the original\\nTTFB improvements they were seeing. For example, initially in profiles with\\nCinder enabled engineers found that up to 10% of the execution time was spent\\nin a workflow to just pretty print. Turns out, the method of memoization used\\ncaused a _repr()_ to happen on an underlying data structure, which just so\\nhappened to be huge in typical ML scenarios. Instead, they made an object\\nwrapper on this underlying data structure and made memoization comparisons\\nusing the [object\\nidentities](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html) instead.\\n\\nAI Lab verified the improvement, enabling them to proceed with rolling out the\\nchange.\\n\\n### Defensively\\n\\nAround when Cinder began rolling out, a regression just so happened to occur\\nthat was completely unrelated to the rollout. In this new regression, an\\nengineer added some logging that they believed was being done\\n[asynchronously](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine).\\nUnbeknownst to them, the call was actually blocking due to one of the nested\\nclients they required being synchronous. AI Lab leveraged [Incident\\nTracker](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/03/05/developer-tools/incident-\\ntracker/) and automatically attributed the regression down to the specific\\nchange. The change author of the regression was notified shortly afterwards,\\nreverting their change before the release went out to production.\\n\\nThanks to AI Lab, the engineers working on Cinder never had to worry about a\\nTTFB regression occurring in the same release they rolled out in, avoiding a\\npotential rollback.\\n\\n![](https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-Lab-\\nimage-3.png?w=1024)AI Lab root causing a specific change that caused a TTFB\\nregression.\\n\\n\\n\\n## How to achieve prevention at Meta’s scale\\n\\nWe want to give accurate TTFB signals as early as possible in the development\\ncycle, but it’s infeasible to benchmark all ML scenarios for every change made\\nby every engineer at Meta. Instead, similar to [predictive test\\nselection](https://engineering.fb.com/2018/11/21/developer-tools/predictive-\\ntest-selection/), we establish a limit on capacity used and set out to find as\\nmany regressions/improvements as early in the development cycle as possible.\\nIn practice, this means:\\n\\n![](https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-Lab-\\nimage-4.png?w=1024)AI Lab integrating at various stages pre-production.\\n\\n\\n\\n  1. **O(Code Changes):** Running relevant, effective, and computationally efficient (often CPU-only) AI Lab tests on prospective changes before they are even reviewed.\\n  2. **O(Releases):** Running a more holistic set of AI Lab tests prior to release and performing a [bisect-like](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/03/05/developer-tools/incident-tracker/) attribution process to find the root cause.\\n    1. Attribution in this manner is highly effective and efficient; it serves as a great fallback when we must run more computationally intensive tests to find a certain regression.\\n\\n![](https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-Lab-\\nimage-5.png?w=981)AI Lab’s high-level end-to-end flow.\\n\\n\\n\\nShould we find a statistically significant change per a\\n[t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test), we perform\\nadditional checks before marking it as a regression/improvement:\\n\\n  1. Run confirmation runs to confirm we confidently reproduce the expected regression/improvement.\\n  2. Ensure the size of the regression/improvement is above a dynamic threshold based on the standard deviation of the test and a tuned [receiver operating characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic). For example, a partner may require <1 false positive per week, which sets the threshold for our tests to find as many true positives as possible whilst staying below that.\\n\\n## Inviting industry collaboration\\n\\nWhile AI Lab is an internal-only tool at Meta, we would love to hear from\\nmembers of the community who may be running similar platforms. Synthetic\\nsignal production is a boon to both developers and users. When developers can\\nrapidly evaluate a hypothesis, and users can experience fewer regressions, it\\nspeeds up AI innovation across the industry. We’d love to collaborate with the\\nindustry to explore more ways we can improve on tools like AI Lab and optimize\\nmore metrics like TTFB.\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\n\\n_AI Lab was made possible due to the foundational work of_[\\n_MobileLab_](https://engineering.fb.com/2018/10/19/android/mobilelab/) _.
